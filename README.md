It seems the unofficial Diablo 4 Armory https://d4armory.io/ is no longer active.

## Overview

Use the unofficial Diablo 4 Armory https://d4armory.io/ to snapshot your characters data, combined with Github actions to fetch and store the data on a schedule

Using this you can track your characters until/if Blizzard create an official API.

## Details

- Based off of https://github.com/patrickloeber/python-github-action-template for using Github actions to run on a schedule
- By default the script is run every twelve hours as specified in `.github/workflows/actions.yml`. I'd caution against running this too often as it would put a load on the kind folks at d4armory.io

## Setup

### Find Your Account ID

To find your account id:
- Open Diablo IV install directory
- Open `FenrisDebug.txt`
- Search for 'account_id'

### Register your characters on d4armory.io
- Head to https://d4armory.io/
- Search for your account using the account_id you fetched from `FenrisDebug.txt`
- Confirm you can see your characters, there may be some latency

### Setup your Clone of this Repo
- Fork or Create a copy of this repo using the [Use this template](https://github.com/ryancollingwood/diablo_4_armory_fetcher/generate) button

#### Setup Repo Secrets
- In your repo on github head to `settings` -> `secrets` -> `actions`
- Click `New repository secret`

#### Setup Repo Write Permissions
- In your repo on github head to `settings` -> `actions`

## Constructing Data History
- Clone the repo to your local computer
- (Optional, but recommended) Create an python environment and activate it
- Install the requirements - e.g. `pip install requirements.txt`
- Run the following terminal command in the repo folder `python reconstruct_historical_data.py`
- Your characters changes will be written by default as JSON line format to `data_history` directory

## TODO:
- Check the status endpoint before proceeding with fetching chars
